# Fungo

This is a repo to have fun with
[Tango with Django](http://www.tangowithdjango.com) course. It's always too
boring to replicate something that's already done for you, so this is not
exactly that [Rango](http://www.tangowithdjango.com/rango/) app, but
something else.

Here is some differences:

* it's called *Fungo*, man (although I'm staring to hate words that end with
  “ango”, just kinda saturation);

* it's in Python 3, not Python 2;

* it uses Django 1.8.
